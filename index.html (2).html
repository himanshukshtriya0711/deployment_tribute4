                <p class="para-2">Jonathan Byers, a central figure in Stranger Things played by Charlie Heaton, is the big brother that everybody needs. He’s there with a baseball bat in his hand when you have a monster chasing you and he’ll follow you through a portal to another dark realm if you are chasing a monster. His growth — from a timid, overshadowed teen with bitter feelings toward his mom Joyce Byers, to a courageous young man — is upfront and personal. While the audiences aren’t necessarily good fans of his hairstyle (unlike Steve), they know he means business when he has friends willing to travel hundreds of miles to help his brother’s friends.</p>
